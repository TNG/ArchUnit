== The Lang API

=== Composing Class Rules

<<The Core API>> is pretty powerful with regard to all the details from the bytecode
that it provides to tests. However, tests written this way lack conciseness and fail to convey the
architectural concept that they should assert. Consider:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
Set<JavaClass> services = new HashSet<>();
for (JavaClass clazz : classes) {
    // choose those classes with FQN with infix '.service.'
    if (clazz.getName().contains(".service.")) {
        services.add(clazz);
    }
}

for (JavaClass service : services) {
    for (JavaAccess<?> access : service.getAccessesFromSelf()) {
        String targetName = access.getTargetOwner().getName();

        // fail if the target FQN has the infix ".controller."
        if (targetName.contains(".controller.")) {
            String message = String.format(
                    "Service %s accesses Controller %s in line %d",
                    service.getName(), targetName, access.getLineNumber());
            Assert.fail(message);
        }
    }
}
----

What we want to express, is the rule _"no classes that reside in a package 'service' should
access classes that reside in a package 'controller'"_. Nevertheless, it's hard to read through
that code and distill that information. And the same process has to be done every time, someone
needs to understand the semantics of this rule.

To solve this shortcoming, ArchUnit offers a high level API to express architectural concepts
in a concise way. In fact, we can write code, that is almost equivalent to the prose rule text
mentioned before:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ArchRule rule = ArchRuleDefinition.noClasses()
    .that().resideInAPackage("..service..")
    .should().accessClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..controller..");

rule.check(importedClasses);
----

The only difference to colloquial language, are the ".." in the package notation,
which refers to any number of packages. Thus "..service.." just expresses
"any package that contains some sub-package 'service'", e.g. `com.myapp.service.any`.
If this test fails, it will report an `AssertionError` with the following message:

[source,bash]
----
java.lang.AssertionError: Architecture Violation [Priority: MEDIUM] -
Rule 'no classes that reside in a package '..service..'
should access classes that reside in a package '..controller..'' was violated (1 times):
Method <some.pkg.service.SomeService.callController()>
calls method <some.pkg.controller.SomeController.execute()>
in (SomeService.java:14)
----

So as a benefit, the assertion error contains the full rule text out of the box and reports
all violations including the exact class and line number. The rule API also allows to combine
predicates and conditions:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
noClasses()
    .that().resideInAPackage("..service..")
    .or().resideInAPackage("..persistence..")
    .should().accessClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..controller..")
    .orShould().accessClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..ui..")

rule.check(importedClasses);
----

=== Composing Member Rules

In addition to a predefined API to write rules about Java classes and their relations, there is
an extended API to define rules for members of Java classes. This might be relevant for example,
if methods in a certain context need to be annotated with a specific annotation or return
types implementing a certain interface. The entry point is again `ArchRuleDefinition`, e.g.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ArchRule rule = ArchRuleDefinition.methods()
    .that().arePublic()
    .and().areDeclaredInClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..controller..")
    .should().beAnnotatedWith(Secured.class);

rule.check(importedClasses);
----

=== Creating Custom Rules

In fact, most architectural rules take the form

[source]
----
classes that ${PREDICATE} should ${CONDITION}
----

In other words, we always want to limit imported classes to a relevant subset, and then
evaluate some condition to see that all those classes satisfy it.
ArchUnit's API allows you, to do just that, by exposing the concepts of `DescribedPredicate`
and `ArchCondition`. So the rule above, is just an application of this generic API:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> resideInAPackageService = // define the predicate
ArchCondition<JavaClass> accessClassesThatResideInAPackageController = // define the condition

noClasses().that(resideInAPackageService)
    .should(accessClassesThatResideInAPackageController);
----

Thus, if the predefined API does not allow to express some concept, it is possible to extend
it in any custom way, for example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> haveAFieldAnnotatedWithPayload =
    new DescribedPredicate<JavaClass>("have a field annotated with @Payload"){
        @Override
        public boolean apply(JavaClass input) {
            boolean someFieldAnnotatedWithPayload = // iterate fields and check for @Payload
            return someFieldAnnotatedWithPayload;
        }
    };

ArchCondition<JavaClass> onlyBeAccessedBySecuredMethods =
    new ArchCondition<JavaClass>("only be accessed by @Secured methods") {
        @Override
        public void check(JavaClass item, ConditionEvents events) {
            for (JavaMethodCall call : item.getMethodCallsToSelf()) {
                if (!call.getOrigin().isAnnotatedWith(Secured.class)) {
                    String message = String.format(
                        "Method %s is not @Secured", call.getOrigin().getFullName());
                    events.add(SimpleConditionEvent.violated(call, message));
                }
            }
        }
    };

classes().that(haveAFieldAnnotatedWithPayload).should(onlyBeAccessedBySecuredMethods);
----

If the rule fails, the error message will be built from the supplied descriptions. In the
example above, it would be

[source]
----
classes that have a field annotated with @Payload should only be accessed by @Secured methods
----

=== Predefined Predicates and Conditions

Often custom predicates and conditions like in the last section can be composed from
predefined elements. ArchUnit's basic convention for predicates is, that they are defined
in an inner class `Predicates` within the type they target. For example, one can find the
predicate to check for the simple name of a `JavaClass` as

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
JavaClass.Predicates.simpleName(String)
----

Predicates can be joined using the methods `predicate.or(other)` and `predicate.and(other)`.
So for example a predicate testing for a class with simple name "Foo" that is serializable
could be created the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
import static com.tngtech.archunit.core.domain.JavaClass.Predicates.assignableTo;
import static com.tngtech.archunit.core.domain.JavaClass.Predicates.simpleName;

DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> serializableNamedFoo =
    simpleName("Foo").and(assignableTo(Serializable.class));
----

Note that for some properties, there exist interfaces with predicates defined for them.
For example the property to have a name is represented by the interface `HasName`, consequently
the predicate to check the name of a `JavaClass`, is the same as the predicate to check the name
of a `JavaMethod` and resides within

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
HasName.Predicates.name(String)
----

This can at times lead to problems with the type system, if predicates are supposed to be joined.
Since the `or(..)` method accepts a type of `DescribedPredicate<? super T>`,
where `T` is the type of the first predicate. For example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
// Does not compile, because type(..) targets a subtype of HasName
HasName.Predicates.name("").and(JavaClass.Predicates.type(Serializable.class))

// Does compile, because name(..) targets a supertype of JavaClass
JavaClass.Predicates.type(Serializable.class).and(HasName.Predicates.name(""))

// Does compile, because the compiler now sees name(..) as a predicate for JavaClass
DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> name = HasName.Predicates.name("").forSubType();
name.and(JavaClass.Predicates.type(Serializable.class));
----

This behavior is somewhat tedious, but unfortunately it is a shortcoming of the Java
type system, that cannot be circumvented in a satisfying way.

Just like predicates, there exist predefined conditions, that can be combined in a similar
way. Since `ArchCondition` is a less generic concept, all predefined conditions can be found
within `ArchConditions`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ArchCondition<JavaClass> callEquals =
    ArchConditions.callMethod(Object.class, "equals", Object.class);
ArchCondition<JavaClass> callHashCode =
    ArchConditions.callMethod(Object.class, "hashCode");

ArchCondition<JavaClass> callEqualsOrHashCode = callEquals.or(callHashCode);
----

=== Rules with Custom Concepts

Earlier we stated, that most architectural rules take the form

[source]
----
classes that ${PREDICATE} should ${CONDITION}
----

However, we do not always talk about classes, if we express architectural concepts. We might
have custom language, we might talk about modules, about slices, or on the other hand more
detailed about fields, methods or constructors. A generic API will never be able to support
every imaginable concept out of the box. Thus ArchUnit's rule API has at its foundation
a more generic API, that controls the types of objects that our concept targets.

[plantuml, "import-vs-lang"]
----
skinparam componentStyle uml2

skinparam component {
  BorderColor #grey
  BackgroundColor #white
}

skinparam class {
  BorderColor #grey
  BackgroundColor #white
}

JavaClasses -right->[transform] CustomObjects
CustomObjects -right->[passed to] "ArchRule
<i>composed of DescribedPredicate<CustomObject></i>
<i>and ArchCondition<CustomObject></i>"
----

To achieve this, any rule definition is based on a `ClassesTransformer` that defines, how
`JavaClasses` are to be transformed to the desired rule input. In many cases, like the ones
mentioned in the sections above, this is the identity transformation, passing classes on to the rule
as they are. However, one can supply any custom transformation to express a rule about a
different type of input object. For example:

// FIXME: This example is obsolete once the members API is merged
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ClassesTransformer<JavaField> fields = new AbstractClassesTransformer<JavaField>("fields") {
    @Override
    public Iterable<JavaField> doTransform(JavaClasses classes) {
        Set<JavaField> result = new HashSet<>();
        for (JavaClass javaClass : classes) {
            result.addAll(javaClass.getFields());
        }
        return result;
    }
};

all(fields).that(have(modifier(PUBLIC))).should(...)
----

Of course these transformers can represent any custom concept desired:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
// how we map classes to business modules
ClassesTransformer<BusinessModule> businessModules = ...

// filter business module dealing with orders
DescribedPredicate<BusinessModule> dealWithOrders = ...

// check that the actual business module is independent of payment
ArchCondition<BusinessModule> beIndependentOfPayment = ...

all(businessModules).that(dealWithOrders).should(beIndependentOfPayment);
----

=== Controlling the Rule Text

If the rule is straight forward, the rule text that is created automatically should be
sufficient in many cases. However, for rules that are not common knowledge, it is good practice
to document the reason for this rule. This can be done the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
classes().that(haveAFieldAnnotatedWithPayload).should(onlyBeAccessedBySecuredMethods)
    .because("@Secured methods will be intercepted, checking for increased priviledges " +
        "and obfuscating sensitive auditing information");
----

Nevertheless sometimes the generated rule text might not convey the real intention
concisely enough (e.g. if multiple predicates or conditions are joined). In those cases
it is possible, to completely override the rule text:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
classes().that(haveAFieldAnnotatedWithPayload).should(onlyBeAccessedBySecuredMethods)
    .as("Payload may only be accessed in a secure way");
----

=== Ignoring Violations

In legacy projects there might be too many violations to fix at once. Nevertheless, that code
should be covered completely by architecture tests, to ensure that no further violations will
be added to the existing code. One approach to ignore existing violations is
to tailor the `that(..)` clause of the rules in question, to ignore certain violations.
A more generic approach is, to ignore violations based on simple regex matches.
For this one can put a file named `archunit_ignore_patterns.txt` in the root of the classpath.
Every line will be interpreted as a regular expression and checked against reported violations.
Violations with a message matching the pattern will be ignored. If no violations are left,
the check will pass.

For example, suppose the class `some.pkg.LegacyService` violates a lot of different rules.
It is possible to add

[source,bash]
.archunit_ignore_patterns.txt
----
.*some\.pkg\.LegacyService.*
----

All violations mentioning `some.pkg.LegacyService` will consequently be ignored, and rules that
are only violated by such violations will report success instead of failure.

It is possible to add comments to ignore patterns by prefixing the line with a '#':

[source,bash]
.archunit_ignore_patterns.txt
----
# There are many known violations where LegacyService is involved; we'll ignore them all
.*some\.pkg\.LegacyService.*
----
