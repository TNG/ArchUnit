== JUnit Support

At the moment ArchUnit offers extended support for writing tests with JUnit 4 and JUnit 5.
This mainly tackles the problem of caching classes between test runs and to remove some boilerplate.

Consider a straight forward approach to write tests:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@Test
public void rule1() {
    JavaClasses importedClasses = new ClassFileImporter().importClasspath();

    ArchRule rule = classes()...

    rule.check(importedClasses);
}

@Test
public void rule2() {
    JavaClasses importedClasses = new ClassFileImporter().importClasspath();

    ArchRule rule = classes()...

    rule.check(importedClasses);
}
----

For bigger projects, this will have a significant performance impact, since the import can take
a noticeable amount of time. Also rules will always be checked against the imported classes, thus
the explicit call of `check(importedClasses)` is bloat and error prone (i.e. it can be forgotten).

=== JUnit 4 & 5 Support

Make sure you follow the installation instructions at <<Installation>>, in particular to include
the correct dependency for the respective JUnit support.

==== Writing tests

Tests look and behave very similar between JUnit 4 and 5. The only difference is, that with JUnit 4
it is necessary to add a specific `Runner` to take care of caching and checking rules, while JUnit 5
picks up the respective `TestEngine` transparently. A test typically looks the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@RunWith(ArchUnitRunner.class) // Remove this line for JUnit 5!!
@AnalyzeClasses(packages = "com.myapp")
public class ArchitectureTest {

    // ArchRules can just be declared as static fields and will be evaluated
    @ArchTest
    public static final ArchRule rule1 = classes().should()...

    @ArchTest
    public static final ArchRule rule2 = classes().should()...

    @ArchTest
    public static void rule3(JavaClasses classes) {
        // The runner also understands static methods with a single JavaClasses argument
        // reusing the cached classes
    }

}
----

The `JavaClass` cache will work in two ways. On the one hand it will cache the classes by test,
so they can be reused by several rules declared within the same class. On the other hand, it
will cache the classes by location, so a second test that wants to import classes from the same
URLs will reuse the classes previously imported as well. Note that this second caching uses
soft references, so the classes will be dropped from memory, if the heap runs low.
For further information see <<Controlling the Cache>>.

==== Controlling the Import

Which classes will be imported can be controlled in a declarative way through `@AnalyzeClasses`.
If no packages or locations are provided, the whole classpath will be imported.
You can specify packages to import as strings:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@AnalyzeClasses(packages = {"com.myapp.subone", "com.myapp.subone"})
----

To better support refactorings, packages can also be declared relative to classes, i.e. the
packages these classes reside in will be imported:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@AnalyzeClasses(packagesOf = {SubOneConfiguration.class, SubTwoConfiguration.class})
----

As a third option, locations can be specified freely by implementing a `LocationProvider`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class MyLocationProvider implements LocationProvider {
    @Override
    public Set<Location> get(Class<?> testClass) {
        // Determine Locations (= URLs) to import
        // Can also consider the actual test class, e.g. to read some custom annotation
    }
}

@AnalyzeClasses(locations = MyLocationProvider.class)
----

Furthermore to choose specific classes beneath those locations, `ImportOptions` can be
specified (compare <<The Core API>>). For example, to import the classpath, but only consider
production code, and only consider code that is directly supplied and does not come from JARs:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@AnalyzeClasses(importOptions = {DoNotIncludeTests.class, DoNotIncludeJars.class})
----

As explained in <<The Core API>>, you can write your own custom implementation of `ImportOption`
and then supply the type to `@AnalyzeClasses`.

==== Controlling the Cache

By default all classes will be cached by location. This means that between different
test class runs imported Java classes will be reused, if the exact combination of locations has already
been imported.

If the heap runs low, and thus the garbage collector has to do a big sweep in one run,
this can cause a noticeable delay. On the other hand, if it is known that no other test class will
reuse the imported Java classes, it would make sense to deactivate this cache.

This can be achieved by configuring `CacheMode.PER_CLASS`, e.g.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@AnalyzeClasses(packages = "com.myapp.special", cacheMode = CacheMode.PER_CLASS)
----

The Java classes imported during this test run will not be cached by location and just be reused within
the same test class. After all tests of this class have been run,
the imported Java classes will simply be dropped.

==== Ignoring Tests

It is possible to skip tests by annotating them with `@ArchIgnore`, for example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class ArchitectureTest {

    // will run
    @ArchTest
    public static final ArchRule rule1 = classes().should()...

    // won't run
    @ArchIgnore
    @ArchTest
    public static final ArchRule rule2 = classes().should()...
}
----

Note for users of JUnit 5: the annotation `@Disabled` has no effect here.
Instead, `@ArchIgnore` should be used.

==== Grouping Rules

Often a project might end up with different categories of rules, for example "service rules"
and "persistence rules". It is possible to write one class for each set of rules, and then
refer to those sets from another test:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public class ServiceRules {
    @ArchTest
    public static final ArchRule ruleOne = ...

    // further rules
}

public class PersistenceRules {
    @ArchTest
    public static final ArchRule ruleOne = ...

    // further rules
}

@RunWith(ArchUnitRunner.class) // Remove this line for JUnit 5!!
@AnalyzeClasses
public class ArchitectureTest {

    @ArchTest
    static final ArchTests serviceRules = ArchTests.in(ServiceRules.class);

    @ArchTest
    static final ArchTests persistenceRules = ArchTests.in(PersistenceRules.class);

}
----

The runner will include all `@ArchTest` annotated members within `ServiceRules` and `PersistenceRules` and evaluate
them against the classes declared within `@AnalyzeClasses` on `ArchitectureTest`.
This also allows an easy reuse of a rule library in different projects or modules.
