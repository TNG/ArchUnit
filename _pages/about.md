ArchUnit is a simple but powerful open-source library to automatically test Java architectures
as plain unit tests.
 
It was originally created by [Peter Gafert](https://github.com/codecholeric) to tackle shortcomings 
of existing free tools / libraries that assert architectural constraints of Java projects. 
Any contributor is welcome and contributions are greatly appreciated :-)
