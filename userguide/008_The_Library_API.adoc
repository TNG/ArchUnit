== The Library API

The Library API offers a growing collection of predefined rules, which offer a more concise API
for more complex but common patterns, like a layered architecture or checks for cycles between
slices (compare <<What to Check>>).


=== Architectures

The entrance point for checks of common architectural styles is:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
com.tngtech.archunit.library.Architectures
----

At the moment this only provides a convenient check for a layered architecture and onion architecture.
But in the future it might be extended for styles like a pipes and filters,
separation of business logic and technical infrastructure, etc.

==== Layered Architecture

In layered architectures, we define different layers and how those interact with each other.
An example setup for a simple 3-tier architecture can be found in <<Layer Checks>>.


==== Onion Architecture

In an "Onion Architecture" (also known as "Hexagonal Architecture" or "Ports and Adapters"),
we can define domain packages and adapter packages as follows.

[source,java]
----
onionArchitecture()
        .domainModels("com.myapp.domain.model..")
        .domainServices("com.myapp.domain.service..")
        .applicationServices("com.myapp.application..")
        .adapter("cli", "com.myapp.adapter.cli..")
        .adapter("persistence", "com.myapp.adapter.persistence..")
        .adapter("rest", "com.myapp.adapter.rest..");
----

The semantic follows the descriptions in https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/.
More precisely, the following holds:

* The `domain` package is the core of the application. It consists of two parts.
    . The `domainModels` packages contain the domain entities.
    . The packages in `domainServices` contains services that use the entities in the `domainModel` packages.
* The `applicationServices` packages contain services and configuration to run the application and use cases.
  It can use the items of the `domain` package but there must not be any dependency from the `domain`
  to the `application` packages.
* The `adapter` package contains logic to connect to external systems and/or infrastructure.
  No adapter may depend on another adapter. Adapters can use both the items of the `domain` as well as
  the `application` packages. Vice versa, neither the `domain` nor the `application` packages must
  contain dependencies on any `adapter` package.

=== Slices

Currently, there are two "slice" rules offered by the Library API. These are basically rules
that slice the code by packages, and contain assertions on those slices. The entrance point is:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
com.tngtech.archunit.library.dependencies.SlicesRuleDefinition
----

The API is based on the idea to sort classes into slices according to one or several package
infixes, and then write assertions against those slices. At the moment this is for example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
// sort classes by the first package after 'myapp'
// then check those slices for cyclic dependencies
SlicesRuleDefinition.slices().matching("..myapp.(*)..").should().beFreeOfCycles()

// checks all subpackages of 'myapp' for cycles
SlicesRuleDefinition.slices().matching("..myapp.(**)").should().notDependOnEachOther()

// sort classes by packages between 'myapp' and 'service'
// then check those slices for not having any dependencies on each other
SlicesRuleDefinition.slices().matching("..myapp.(**).service..").should().notDependOnEachOther()
----

If this constraint is too rigid, e.g. in legacy applications where the package structure is rather
inconsistent, it is possible to further customize the slice creation. This can be done by specifying
a mapping of `JavaClass` to `SliceIdentifier` where classes with the same `SliceIdentifier` will
be sorted into the same slice. Consider this example:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
SliceAssignment legacyPackageStructure = new SliceAssignment() {
    // this will specify which classes belong together in the same slice
    @Override
    public SliceIdentifier getIdentifierOf(JavaClass javaClass) {
        if (javaClass.getPackageName().startsWith("com.oldapp")) {
            return SliceIdentifier.of("Legacy");
        }
        if (javaClass.getName().contains(".esb.")) {
            return SliceIdentifier.of("ESB");
        }
        // ... further custom mappings

        // if the class does not match anything, we ignore it
        return SliceIdentifier.ignore();
    }

    // this will be part of the rule description if the test fails
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "legacy package structure";
    }
};

SlicesRuleDefinition.slices().assignedFrom(legacyPackageStructure).should().beFreeOfCycles()
----

==== Configurations

There are two configuration parameters to adjust the behavior of the cycle detection.
They can be configured via `archunit.properties` (compare <<Advanced Configuration>>).

[source,options="nowrap"]
.archunit.properties
----
# This will limit the maximum number of cycles to detect and thus required CPU and heap.
# default is 100
cycles.maxNumberToDetect=50

# This will limit the maximum number of dependencies to report per cycle edge.
# Note that ArchUnit will regardless always analyze all dependencies to detect cycles,
# so this purely affects how many dependencies will be printed in the report.
# Also note that this number will quickly affect the required heap since it scales with number.
# of edges and number of cycles
# default is 20
cycles.maxNumberOfDependenciesPerEdge=5
----

==== The Cycle Detection Core API

The underlying infrastructure for cycle detection that the `slices()` rule makes use of can also be accessed
without any rule syntax around it. This allows to use the pure cycle detection algorithm in custom
checks or libraries. The core class of the cycle detection is

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
com.tngtech.archunit.library.cycle_detection.CycleDetector
----

It can be used on a set of a generic type `NODE` in combination with a generic `Set<EDGE>`
(where `EDGE implements Edge<NODE>`) representing the edges of the graph:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
Set<MyNode> nodes = // ...
Set<Edge<MyNode>> edges = // ...
Cycles<Edge<MyNode>> foundCycles = CycleDetector.detectCycles(nodes, edges);
----

Edges are parameterized by a generic type `EDGE` to allow custom edge types that can
then transport additional meta-information if needed.


=== Modularization Rules

[NOTE]
Note: ArchUnit doesn't strive to be a "competition" for module systems like the
Java Platform Module System. Such systems have advantages like checks at compile time
versus test time as ArchUnit does. So, if another module system works well in your
environment, there is no need to switch over. But ArchUnit can bring JPMS-like features
to older code bases, e.g. Java 8 projects, or environments where the JPMS is for some
reason no option. It also can accompany a module system by adding additional rules e.g.
on the API of a module.

To express the concept of modularization ArchUnit offers `ArchModule`ï»¿s. The entrypoint into
the API is `ModuleRuleDefinition`, e.g.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ModuleRuleDefinition.modules().definedByPackages("..example.(*)..").should().beFreeOfCycles();
----

As the example shows, it shares some concepts with the <<Slices>> API. For example `definedByPackages(..)`
follows the same semantics as `slices().matching(..)`.
Also, the configuration options for cycle detection mentioned in the last section are shared by these APIs.
But, it also offers several powerful concepts beyond that API to express many different modularization scenarios.

One example would be to express modules via annotation. We can introduce a custom annotation
like `@AppModule` and follow a convention to annotate the top-level `package-info` file
of each package we consider the root of a module. E.g.

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
.com/myapp/example/module_one/package-info.java
----
@AppModule(
  name = "Module One",
  allowedDependencies = {"Module Two", "Module Three"},
  exposedPackages = {"..module_one.api.."}
)
package com.myapp.example.module_one;
----

We can then define a rule using this annotation:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
modules()
  .definedByAnnotation(AppModule.class)
  .should().respectTheirAllowedDependenciesDeclaredIn("allowedDependencies",
      consideringOnlyDependenciesInAnyPackage("..example.."))
  .andShould().onlyDependOnEachOtherThroughPackagesDeclaredIn("exposedPackages")
----

As the example shows, the syntax carries on meta-information (like the annotation of the annotated
`package-info`) into the created `ArchModule` objects where it can
be used to define the rule. In this example, the allowed dependencies are taken from the `@AppModule`
annotation on the respective `package-info` and compared to the actual module dependencies. Any
dependency not listed is reported as violation.
Likewise, the exposed packages are taken from the `@AppModule` annotation and any dependency
where the target class's package doesn't match any declared package identifier is reported
as violation.

Note that the `modules()` API can be adjusted in many ways to model custom requirements.
For further details, please take a look at the examples provided
https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit-Examples/blob/main/example-junit5/src/test/java/com/tngtech/archunit/exampletest/junit5/ModulesTest.java[here].

==== Modularization Core API

The infrastructure to create modules and inspect their dependencies can also be used outside
the rule syntax, e.g. for custom checks or utility code:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ArchModules<?> modules = ArchModules.defineByPackages("..example.(*)..").modularize(javaClasses);
ArchModule<?> coreModule = modules.getByIdentifier("core");
Set<? extends ModuleDependency<?>> coreDependencies = coreModule.getModuleDependenciesFromSelf();
coreDependencies.forEach(...);
----


=== General Coding Rules

The Library API also offers a small set of coding rules that might be useful in various projects.
Those can be found within

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
com.tngtech.archunit.library
----

==== GeneralCodingRules

The class `GeneralCodingRules` contains a set of very general rules and conditions for coding.
For example:

* To check that classes do not access `System.out` or `System.err`, but use logging instead.
* To check that classes do not throw generic exceptions, but use specific exceptions instead.
* To check that classes do not use `java.util.logging`, but use other libraries like Log4j, Logback, or SLF4J instead
* To check that classes do not use JodaTime, but use `java.time` instead.
* To check that classes do not use field injection, but constructor injection instead.

==== DependencyRules

The class `DependencyRules` contains a set of rules and conditions for checking dependencies between classes.
For example:

* To check that classes do not depend on classes from upper packages.

==== ProxyRules

The class `ProxyRules` contains a set of rules and conditions for checking the usage of proxy objects.
For example:

* To check that methods that matches a predicate are not called directly from within the same class.

=== PlantUML Component Diagrams as rules

The Library API offers a feature that supports http://plantuml.com/component-diagram[PlantUML] diagrams.
This feature is located in

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
com.tngtech.archunit.library.plantuml
----

ArchUnit can derive rules straight from PlantUML diagrams and check to make sure that all imported
`JavaClasses` abide by the dependencies of the diagram. The respective rule can be created in the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
URL myDiagram = getClass().getResource("my-diagram.puml");

classes().should(adhereToPlantUmlDiagram(myDiagram, consideringAllDependencies()));
----

Diagrams supported have to be component diagrams and associate classes to components via stereotypes.
The way this works is to use the respective package identifiers (compare
`ArchConditions.onlyHaveDependenciesInAnyPackage(..)`) as stereotypes:

[plantuml, "simple-plantuml-archrule-example", svg, opts=interactive]
----
[Some Source] <<..some.source..>>
[Some Target] <<..some.target..>> as target

[Some Source] --> target
----

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
@startuml
[Some Source] <<..some.source..>>
[Some Target] <<..some.target..>> as target

[Some Source] --> target
@enduml
----

Consider this diagram applied as a rule via `adhereToPlantUmlDiagram(..)`, then for example
a class `some.target.Target` accessing `some.source.Source` would be reported as a violation.

==== Configurations

There are different ways to deal with dependencies of imported classes not covered by the
diagram at all. The behavior of the PlantUML API can be configured by supplying a respective
`Configuration`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
// considers all dependencies possible (including java.lang, java.util, ...)
classes().should(adhereToPlantUmlDiagram(
        mydiagram, consideringAllDependencies())

// considers only dependencies specified in the PlantUML diagram
// (so any unknown dependency will be ignored)
classes().should(adhereToPlantUmlDiagram(
        mydiagram, consideringOnlyDependenciesInDiagram())

// considers only dependencies in any specified package
// (control the set of dependencies to consider, e.g. only com.myapp..)
classes().should(adhereToPlantUmlDiagram(
        mydiagram, consideringOnlyDependenciesInAnyPackage("..some.package.."))
----

It is possible to further customize which dependencies to ignore:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
// there are further ignore flavors available
classes().should(adhereToPlantUmlDiagram(mydiagram).ignoreDependencies(predicate))
----

A PlantUML diagram used with ArchUnit must abide by a certain set of rules:

1. Components must be declared in the bracket notation (i.e. `[Some Component]`)
2. Components must have at least one (possible multiple) stereotype(s). Each stereotype in the diagram
must be unique and represent a valid package identifier (e.g. `\<<..example..>>` where `..` represents
an arbitrary number of packages; compare the core API)
3. Components may have an optional alias (e.g. `[Some Component] \<<..example..>> as myalias`). The alias must be alphanumeric and must not be quoted.
4. Components may have an optional color (e.g. `[Some Component] \<<..example..>> #OrangeRed`)
5. Dependencies must use arrows only consisting of dashes (e.g. `-\->`)
6. Dependencies may go from left to right `-\->` or right to left `\<--`
7. Dependencies may consist of any number of dashes (e.g `\->` or `----\->`)
8. Dependencies may contain direction hints (e.g. `-up\->`) or color directives (e.g. `-[#green]\->`)

=== Freezing Arch Rules

When rules are introduced in grown projects, there are often hundreds or even thousands of violations,
way too many to fix immediately. The only way to tackle such extensive violations is to establish an
iterative approach, which prevents the code base from further deterioration.

`FreezingArchRule` can help in these scenarios by recording all existing violations to a `ViolationStore`.
Consecutive runs will then only report new violations and ignore known violations.
If violations are fixed, `FreezingArchRule` will automatically reduce the known stored violations to prevent any regression.

==== Usage

To freeze an arbitrary `ArchRule` just wrap it into a `FreezingArchRule`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
ArchRule rule = FreezingArchRule.freeze(classes().should()./*complete ArchRule*/);
----

On the first run all violations of that rule will be stored as the current state. On consecutive runs only
new violations will be reported. By default `FreezingArchRule` will ignore line numbers, i.e. if a
violation is just shifted to a different line, it will still count as previously recorded
and will not be reported.

==== Configuration

By default `FreezingArchRule` will use a simple `ViolationStore` based on plain text files.
This is sufficient to add these files to any version control system to continuously track the progress.
You can configure the location of the violation store within `archunit.properties` (compare <<Advanced Configuration>>):

[source,options="nowrap"]
.archunit.properties
----
freeze.store.default.path=/some/path/in/a/vcs/repo
----

Furthermore, it is possible to configure

[source,options="nowrap"]
.archunit.properties
----
# must be set to true to allow the creation of a new violation store
# default is false
freeze.store.default.allowStoreCreation=true

# can be set to false to forbid updates of the violations stored for frozen rules
# default is true
freeze.store.default.allowStoreUpdate=false
----

This can help in CI environments to prevent misconfiguration:
For example, a CI build should probably never create a new the violation store, but operate on
an existing one.

As mentioned in <<Overriding configuration>>, these properties can be passed as system properties as needed.
For example to allow the creation of the violation store in a specific environment, it is possible to pass the system property via

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
-Darchunit.freeze.store.default.allowStoreCreation=true
----

It is also possible to allow all violations to be "refrozen", i.e. the store will just be updated
with the current state, and the reported result will be success. Thus, it is effectively the same behavior
as if all rules would never have been frozen.
This can e.g. make sense, because current violations are consciously accepted and should be added to the store,
or because the format of some violations has changed. The respective property to allow refreezing
all current violations is `freeze.refreeze=true`, where the default is `false`.

==== Extension

`FreezingArchRule` provides two extension points to adjust the behavior to custom needs.
The first one is the `ViolationStore`, i.e. the store violations will be recorded to. The second one
is the `ViolationLineMatcher`, i.e. how `FreezingArchRule` will associate lines of stored violations
with lines of actual violations. As mentioned, by default this is a line matcher that ignores the
line numbers of violations within the same class.

===== Violation Store

As mentioned in <<Configuration>>, the default `ViolationStore` is a simple text based store.
It can be exchanged though, for example to store violations in a database.
To provide your own implementation, implement `com.tngtech.archunit.library.freeze.ViolationStore` and
configure `FreezingArchRule` to use it. This can either be done programmatically:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
FreezingArchRule.freeze(rule).persistIn(customViolationStore);
----

Alternatively it can be configured via `archunit.properties` (compare <<Advanced Configuration>>):

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
freeze.store=fully.qualified.name.of.MyCustomViolationStore
----

You can supply properties to initialize the store by using the namespace `freeze.store`.
For properties

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
freeze.store.propOne=valueOne
freeze.store.propTwo=valueTwo
----

the method `ViolationStore.initialize(props)` will be called with the properties

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
propOne=valueOne
propTwo=valueTwo
----

===== Violation Line Matcher

The `ViolationLineMatcher` compares lines from occurred violations with lines from the store.
The default implementation ignores line numbers and numbers of anonymous classes or lambda expressions,
and counts lines as equivalent when all other details match.
A custom `ViolationLineMatcher` can again either be defined programmatically:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
FreezingArchRule.freeze(rule).associateViolationLinesVia(customLineMatcher);
----

or via `archunit.properties`:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
freeze.lineMatcher=fully.qualified.name.of.MyCustomLineMatcher
----

=== Software Architecture Metrics

Similar to code quality metrics, like cyclomatic complexity or method length,
software architecture metrics strive to measure the structure and design of software.
ArchUnit can be used to calculate some well-known software architecture metrics.
The foundation of these metrics is generally some form of componentization, i.e.
we partition the classes/methods/fields of a Java application into related units
and provide measurements for these units. In ArchUnit this concept is expressed by
`com.tngtech.archunit.library.metrics.MetricsComponent`. For some metrics, like the
Cumulative Dependency Metrics by John Lakos, we also need to know the dependencies
between those components, which are naturally derived from the dependencies between
the elements (e.g. classes) within these components.

A very simple concrete example would be to consider some Java packages as
components and the classes within these packages as the contained elements. From
the dependencies between the classes we can derive which package depends on which
other package.

The following will give a quick overview of the metrics that ArchUnit can calculate.
However, for further background information it is recommended to rely on
some dedicated literature that explains these metrics in full detail.

==== Cumulative Dependency Metrics by John Lakos

These are software architecture metrics as defined by John Lakos in his book
"Large-Scale C++ Software Design". The basic idea is to calculate the `DependsOn`
value for each component, which is the sum of all components that can be
transitively reached from some component including the component itself.

From these values we can derive

* Cumulative Component Dependency (*CCD*):
The sum of all `DependsOn` values of all components
* Average Component Dependency (*ACD*):
The `CCD` divided by the number of all components
* Relative Average Component Dependency (*RACD*):
The `ACD` divided by the number of all components
* Normalized Cumulative Component Dependency (*NCCD*):
The `CCD` of the system divided by the `CCD` of a balanced binary tree with the same number of components

===== Example

[plantuml, "lakos-example", svg, opts=interactive]
----
skinparam componentStyle uml2
skinparam component {
  BorderColor #grey
  BackgroundColor #white
}
skinparam legend {
  BackgroundColor #lightyellow
}

[Component One\nDependsOn: 5] as one
[Component Two\nDependsOn: 4] as two
[Component Three\nDependsOn: 5] as three
[Component Four\nDependsOn: 1] as four
[Component Five\nDependsOn: 2] as five
[Component Six\nDependsOn: 1] as six

one --> two
three --> two
two --> four
two --> five
two --> six
five --> six

legend
| <b>CCD</b>  | 18   |
| <b>ACD</b>  | 3.0  |
| <b>RACD</b> | 0.5  |
| <b>NCCD</b> | 1.29 |
endlegend
----

Thus these metrics provide some insights into the complexity of the dependency graph of a system.
Note that in a cycle all elements have the same `DependsOn` value which will lead to an increased
CCD. In fact for any non-trivial (`n >= 5`) acyclic graph of components the RACD is bound by `0.6`.

===== How to use the API

The values described for these metrics can be calculated in the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
import com.tngtech.archunit.library.metrics.ArchitectureMetrics;
// ...

JavaClasses classes = // ...
Set<JavaPackage> packages = classes.getPackage("com.example").getSubpackages();

// These components can also be created in a package agnostic way, compare MetricsComponents.from(..)
MetricsComponents<JavaClass> components = MetricsComponents.fromPackages(packages);

LakosMetrics metrics = ArchitectureMetrics.lakosMetrics(components);

System.out.println("CCD: " + metrics.getCumulativeComponentDependency());
System.out.println("ACD: " + metrics.getAverageComponentDependency());
System.out.println("RACD: " + metrics.getRelativeAverageComponentDependency());
System.out.println("NCCD: " + metrics.getNormalizedCumulativeComponentDependency());
----

==== Component Dependency Metrics by Robert C. Martin

These software architecture metrics were defined by Robert C. Martin in various sources,
for example in his book "Clean architecture : a craftsman's guide to software structure and design".

The foundation are again components, that must in this case contain classes as their elements
(i.e. these are purely object-oriented metrics that need a concept of abstract classes).

The metrics are based on the following definitions:

* Efferent Coupling (*Ce*): The number of outgoing dependencies to any other component
* Afferent Coupling (*Ca*): The number of incoming dependencies from any other component
* Instability (*I*): `Ce / (Ca + Ce)`, i.e. the relationship of outgoing dependencies
to all dependencies
* Abstractness (*A*): `num(abstract_classes) / num(all_classes)` in the component
* Distance from Main Sequence (*D*): `| A + I - 1 |`, i.e. the normalized distance from
the ideal line between `(A=1, I=0)` and `(A=0, I=1)`

Note that ArchUnit slightly differs from the original definition. In ArchUnit
the Abstractness value is only based on public classes, i.e.
classes that are visible from the outside. The reason is that *Ce*, *Ca* and *I* all
are metrics with respect to coupling of components. But only classes that are visible
to the outside can affect coupling between components,
so it makes sense to only consider those classes to calculate the *A* value.

===== Example

The following provides some example where the `A` values assume some random factor
of abstract classes within the respective component.

[plantuml, "martin-example", svg, opts=interactive]

skinparam componentStyle uml2
skinparam component {
  BorderColor #grey
  BackgroundColor #white
}
skinparam legend {
  BackgroundColor #lightyellow
}

[Component One\nCe: 1\nCa: 0\nI: 1.0\nA: 0.33\nD: 0.33] as one
[Component Two\nCe: 3\nCa: 2\nI: 0.6\nA: 0.5\nD: 0.1] as two
[Component Three\nCe: 1\nCa: 0\nI: 1.0\nA: 0.0\nD: 0.0] as three
[Component Four\nCe: 0\nCa: 1\nI: 0.0\nA: 0.0\nD: 1.0] as four
[Component Five\nCe: 1\nCa: 1\nI: 0.5\nA: 0.66\nD: 0.16] as five
[Component Six\nCe: 0\nCa: 2\nI: 0.0\nA: 0.0\nD: 1.0] as six

one --> two
three --> two
two --> four
two --> five
two --> six
five --> six

===== How to use the API

The values described for these metrics can be calculated in the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
import com.tngtech.archunit.library.metrics.ArchitectureMetrics;
// ...

JavaClasses classes = // ...
Set<JavaPackage> packages = classes.getPackage("com.example").getSubpackages();

MetricsComponents<JavaClass> components = MetricsComponents.fromPackages(packages);

ComponentDependencyMetrics metrics = ArchitectureMetrics.componentDependencyMetrics(components);

System.out.println("Ce: " + metrics.getEfferentCoupling("com.example.component"));
System.out.println("Ca: " + metrics.getAfferentCoupling("com.example.component"));
System.out.println("I: " + metrics.getInstability("com.example.component"));
System.out.println("A: " + metrics.getAbstractness("com.example.component"));
System.out.println("D: " + metrics.getNormalizedDistanceFromMainSequence("com.example.component"));
----

==== Visibility Metrics by Herbert Dowalil

These software architecture metrics were defined by Herbert Dowalil in his book
"Modulare Softwarearchitektur: Nachhaltiger Entwurf durch Microservices, Modulithen und SOA 2.0".
They provide a measure for the Information Hiding Principle, i.e. the relation of visible to hidden
elements within a component.

The metrics are composed from the following definitions:

* Relative Visibility (*RV*): `num(visible_elements) / num(all_elements)` for each component
* Average Relative Visibility (*ARV*): The average of all `RV` values
* Global Relative Visibility (*GRV*): `num(visible_elements) / num(all_elements)` over all components

===== Example

===== How to use the API

The values described for these metrics can be calculated in the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
import com.tngtech.archunit.library.metrics.ArchitectureMetrics;
// ...

JavaClasses classes = // ...
Set<JavaPackage> packages = classes.getPackage("com.example").getSubpackages();

// These components can also be created in a package agnostic way, compare MetricsComponents.from(..)
MetricsComponents<JavaClass> components = MetricsComponents.fromPackages(packages);

VisibilityMetrics metrics = ArchitectureMetrics.visibilityMetrics(components);

System.out.println("RV : " + metrics.getRelativeVisibility("com.example.component"));
System.out.println("ARV: " + metrics.getAverageRelativeVisibility());
System.out.println("GRV: " + metrics.getGlobalRelativeVisibility());
