 * Generic interface for an object that gathers lines of text.

 * There seem to be more clients that are interested in the raw lines than meaningful implementations of this interface.
 * In particular it seems hard to imagine any implementation that would not simply add
 * {@link ConditionEvent#getDescriptionLines()} to the supplied {@link CollectsLines}. Moreover this interface
 * violates ArchUnit's typical pattern of immutability.
