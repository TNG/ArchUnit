/**
 * Allows to join together any existing {@link ArchCondition} of this rule with another {@link ArchCondition}
 * via {@link #andShould() and} or {@link #orShould() or}. Note that the behavior is always fully left-associative, i.e. there is no
 * "operator precedence" as for {@code &&} or {@code ||}. Take for example
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * classes()...should().bePublic().orShould().bePrivate().andShould().haveNameMatching(pattern)
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * The semantics of the new condition will be {@code (public OR private) AND haveNameMatching}
 * â€“ and not {@code public || (private && haveNameMatching)}.
 * <br><br>
 * Thus, for more complex conditions please consider explicitly joining {@link ArchConditions preconfigured conditions}
 * or custom {@link ArchCondition conditions} via {@link ArchCondition#and(ArchCondition)} and {@link ArchCondition#or(ArchCondition)}
 * where you can freely control the precedence via nesting. E.g.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * classes()...should(
 *   bePublic().or(
 *     bePrivate().and(haveNameMatching(pattern))
 *   )
 * )
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Note that inverting the rule, e.g. via {@link ArchRuleDefinition#noClasses()}, will also invert the join operator. I.e.
 * if you define {@code noClasses().should().a().orShould().b()} it will mean that all classes must satisfy {@code not(a) AND not(b)}.
