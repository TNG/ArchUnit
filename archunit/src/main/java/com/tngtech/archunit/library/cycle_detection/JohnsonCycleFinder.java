/**
 * An implementation of Johnson's algorithm to find cycles within an uni-directed graph
 * (cf. Johnson, <i>Finding all Elementary Cycles in a Directed Graph</i>, Siam J. Computing Vol. 4 No. 1 March 1975)
 * <br><br>
 * The idea is to iterate the graph (represented as integer nodes and edges between two integer nodes)
 * and for each node index find the next strongly connected component with the lowest index.
 * Once found we will look for (elementary) cycles within this strongly connected component. Obviously we are thus
 * only ever interested in strongly connected components of size greater than 1. We take the lowest node index
 * of the strongly connected component as our starting point and only look for paths through the strongly
 * connected component that lead back to this starting point. Once we found all cycles through the starting node this way,
 * we remove the starting node from the graph (look at the induced sub graph of node indexes larger than the staring
 * node index) and repeat the process (i.e. find the next strongly connected component within that graph and find
 * all cycles through the starting node).
 * To make this process efficient, Johnson uses a couple of data structures, represented within {@link JohnsonComponent}.
 * Notably we
 * <ul>
 *     <li>put each node we visit on a stack so if we find back to our starting node
 *         we can pop the stack and thus have a cycle</li>
 *     <li>we record each node we visit in a blocked set so we do not visit nodes twice
 *         of which we know they cannot lead back to the starting node</li>
 *     <li>we keep a map of dependently blocked node indexes. If we run into a dead end,
 *         because the target node we want to visit through an edge is already blocked,
 *         we record this in this map. If we find a cycle and the target node gets unblocked,
 *         we will then also unblock this node to open the possibility to find another cycle
 *         (if the target node will never be unblocked we have not found a cycle through
 *         this node and thus there cannot be a way back from this node to the starting node.
 *         We then also never need to unblock this node, if all its descendants cannot lead
 *         back to the starting node)</li>
 * </ul>
