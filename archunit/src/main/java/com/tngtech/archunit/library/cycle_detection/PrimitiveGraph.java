 * An optimized graph stripped down to the bare minimum for cycle detection.
 * We represent nodes as integers from 0 ..< graph.size() and an edge as an array of two integers (node origin and node target).
 * To further optimize we represent all edges of a graph as a 2-dim array where the first index represents the node origin and
 * all entries for this index represent node targets, e.g.
 * {1 -> 2}, {1 -> 3}, {3 -> 5} => edges == [[], [2, 3], [], [5]]
